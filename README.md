About HMJ Graphed
HMJ Graphed is a trading simulation application. It provides users with the ability to buy and sell Dow Jones Industrial stocks using actual historical data. When the user starts the simulation, real end-of-day prices going back 20 years will start changing in real-time on the screen. In the simulation, a day goes by in 2 seconds. The user can buy and sell, seeing his current profit and loss, also changing in real-time.

An api is also available that can be used to test automated trading algorithms.
